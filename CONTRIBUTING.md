# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are welcome!

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines.

## A Note on Repo AWSomeness

Each repo listed meets at least one of the following requirements:

* Community-authored repo with 100+ stars
* Community-vouched repo with < 100 stars
* Official repo from [aws](https://github.com/aws) or [awslabs](https://github.com/awslabs)

100+ stars for community repos is not a strict requirement, it only serves as a guideline for the initial compilation.  If you can vouch for the awesomeness of a repo with < 100 stars and you can explain why it should be listed, please submit a pull request.

Pull requests might be left open for a period of time to let the community chime in and vouch for it.  An official repo from [aws](https://github.com/aws) or [awslabs](https://github.com/awslabs) can be removed if the community wishes.  Check out the [awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md).
